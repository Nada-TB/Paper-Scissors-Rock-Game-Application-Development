## Introduction

The Paper Scissors Rock Game Application was developed to upgrade the traditional game using modern web technologies and practices. The project aimed to elevate the user experience by leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and ES6 features, adding rounds functionality, and implementing a chronometer for enhanced gameplay.

The motivation behind this project was to practice and demonstrate skills in advanced JavaScript programming, particularly OOP, and to create a dynamic, interactive, and engaging game. The application allows users to play Paper Scissors Rock against the computer.

The main objectives of the project were to:
- Provide an engaging and interactive gaming experience.
- Upgrade the game using OOP and ES6 features for better code maintainability and scalability.
- Implement rounds functionality and use a chronometer for real-time feedback.


## Demo


### Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://nada-tb.github.io/Paper-Scissors-Rock-Game-Application-Development/).


## Installation

To run the Paper Scissors Rock game application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
```bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/Nada-TB/Paper-Scissors-Rock-Game-Application-Development.git

```
Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
Copier le code
cd your-repo-name

```
Open the Project:
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser directly.
You can do this by double-clicking the file or using a local server if needed (optional).

### Requirements

Web Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or any modern web browser.

## Usage

1. **Open the Game**:
   - After opening `index.html` in your web browser, the game will load and be ready for play.

2. **Playing the Game**:
   - **Select Your Move**: Click on the image that represents your choice (Paper, Scissors, or Rock).
   - **View Computer's Choice**: The computer's choice will be displayed automatically after you make your selection.
   - **Check the Result**: The game will determine the winner for that round and update the scores accordingly.

3. **Start New Game**:
   - The game automatically resets after each round, so you can continue playing as many rounds as you like.

### Example

1. Click on an image to choose your move.
2. The computer's choice appears, and the winner is displayed.
3. Scores are updated, and you can see the results of the current round.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**:
  - Allows the user to play the classic game of Paper Scissors Rock against the computer.
  - The user makes their choice by clicking on an image representing Paper, Scissors, or Rock.

- **Computer Opponent**:
  - The computer’s choice is selected randomly from the three options and displayed to the user.

- **Dynamic Scoring System**:
  - Points are awarded based on the outcome of each round, with the winner receiving one point.
  - Both player and computer scores are updated and displayed at the end of each round.

- **Infinite Rounds**:
  - Players can continue playing indefinitely, with scores persisting across rounds.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - Applied ES6 principles and OOP to structure game logic and enhance code maintainability.

- **Responsive User Interface**:
  - Designed a responsive UI to ensure a seamless experience on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and styling.
- **ES6**: For modern JavaScript features.
- **OOP**: For organizing code.
- **Responsive Design**: To ensure the application is usable on various devices and screen sizes.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Enhance User Experience

Action: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing user interface with smooth animations and transitions.

Result: Received positive feedback from users on the dynamic gameplay and interactive elements of the application, indicating an improved user experience and engagement.

- Optimize Code Structure and Readability

Action: Organized the codebase using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and ES6 features.
Result: Achieved cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code, facilitating seamless collaboration and codebase management within the development team.

## Future Improvements

1. **Design Enhancements**
   - Implement more sophisticated design elements and animations to further enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

2. **Multiplayer Functionality**
   - Develop real-time multiplayer capabilities, allowing users to compete against other players rather than just the computer.

3. **Advanced Computer Logic**
   - Incorporate more complex algorithms for the computer's choice to provide a more challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
